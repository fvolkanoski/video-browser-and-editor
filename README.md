# Video Browser & Editor
Simple video browser and editor. It can preview videos, edit them with 3 elements (text, rectangle, progress bar), save and preview edited videos.

# Getting Started
## Requirements
- The project has been built and tested on Desktop Qt 5.12.2 GCC 64 bit (but it will probably work on any platform).
- QtAV 1.6
- OpenCV 4.0

# Installation
- The project uses QtAV version 1.6 (but you can use any version). The building instructions are on the <a href="https://github.com/wang-bin/QtAV">QtAV repository</a>. 
- You will also need <a href="https://docs.opencv.org/master/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html">OpenCV 4.0</a>.
- After these libraries are built and sucessfully installed in the qt compiler directory you can build the project.
